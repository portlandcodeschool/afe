This class introduces state of the art tools and techniques used by professional software developers. It continues to explore the use of JavaScript in creating interactive, data-driven web sites, building on our Web Foundations courses.

These tools and techniques include:

* Task automation to reduce repetitive tasks and improve quality
* CSS preprocessors to improve code design and flexibility
* Browser-based acceptance testing with Selenium IDE and web driver
* Chrome Developer Tools for debugging AJAX transactions and CSS using source maps
