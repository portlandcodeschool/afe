Tools Installation
===================

If you haven't already, make sure you've installed the following on your machine:

1. [Sublime Text 3][st3], a powerful, lightweight text editor
2. [Google Chrome][chrome], the browser you'll use for development
3. If you're on a Mac, Xcode Command Line Tools:
    * [for Mavericks][mavericks]
    * [for Mountain Lion][mtnlion]
    * other versions of OS X: download from [Apple][others] (free sign-up required)
4. [Git][git], a version-control system
5. [SourceTree][sourcetree], an optional GUI for Git
6. Sign up for a [GitHub account][github]

[mtnlion]: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/15940843/command_line_tools_for_osx_mountain_lion_april_2014.dmg
[others]: http://developer.apple.com
[git]: http://git-scm.com/downloads
[sourcetree]: http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/download

* Mac users: Place Terminal in your Dock
* Windows users: Place Git Bash (installed with Git) in your Start menu


<!-- Setting up Terminal (Macs)


Copy and paste the following into Terminal:

{% highlight text %}
ln -s "/Applications/Sublime Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl" ~/usr/local/bin/subl
echo "export EDITOR='subl -w'" >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile
{% endhighlight %}

The first line will allow you to open Sublime Text from the command line by issuing `subl`. The second will make ST your default command-line text editor. -->



Preparation for the Course
=========================
Treehouse is an incredible resource, and handsdown the most valuable resource you'll get from taking this class. But you're not coming to Portland Code School to learn whatever Treehouse has, so there will be some specific badges you should earn that fit specifically with the Primer Basic curriculum.

Before you come to the first class, please complete the following badges on Treehouse

1. [Beginning HTML and CSS](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/how-to-make-a-website)
2. [HTML First](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/how-to-make-a-website)
3. [What is CSS?](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/how-to-make-a-website) Note: This is just one video in the CSS: Cascading Style Sheets badge
4. [Why Version Control Matters](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/git-basics)


Textbooks
=========

There is no *required* textbook for this class.  We will use online resources -- they tend to be more up to date and are much cheaper.

However, there is a pair of books that several students *highly recommend* and that we use in the Web Front End course. They are very approachable and provide clear introductions to what can be very obscure topics. The HTML/CSS one is a year or two old, but still accurate, and the JavaScript one is very up to date and, in general, excellent.

Here's a [link to them on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Web-Design-HTML-JavaScript-jQuery/dp/1118907442/ref=asap_B001IR3Q7I_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1415837047&sr=1-1)

PCS doesn't make any money on this link.

I don't know of any legitimate sources of ebook versions. The layout of the books is so sumptuous, however, that you'll enjoy the paper version.

Prep work
==========
1. Possible: sections of [Dive Into HTML5](http://diveintohtml5.info) (est: 5 hrs)
2. Read [Learn to Code HTML & CSS](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/) (est: 5 hours)

Pre-Course Assessment
======================

Before the first class meeting, complete the pre-course assessment. <br><br>

The assessment is meant primarily as a diagnostic to help the instructional staff see what areas we need to focus on during our in-person meetings.
